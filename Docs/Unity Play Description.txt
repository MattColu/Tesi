After the introductory level you will be asked to drive 4 laps on 5 tracks of increasing difficulty.
The objective is just to drive as you would normally, don't stress out!

Controls:
WASD or ↑←↓→ to move,
R to reset to last checkpoint.

Guidelines:
Use a nickname you can remember (the same nickname can be used all the times you want);
PLEASE don't actively try to break my game (e.g. drive backwards, get out of bounds) in the timed levels, I know it's fun and easy but doing this WILL affect the generated AI;
I will discard incomplete runs, so if you mess something up feel free to start a new run (just refresh the page).

Scope:
The data that you submit (i.e. your driving) will be used to train an AI system on your driving style.
The nickname you enter will only be used to recognize your performance and its respective model for an hypotetical second phase, where real players are switched in and out with their models.
